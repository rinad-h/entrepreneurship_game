                    <p>The Amazon Fire Phone was launched in July 2014 as Amazon's first smartphone, developed under
                        Jeff Bezos and the Amazon Devices team. It was designed to tie users deeper into Amazon's
                        ecosystem, including Prime, shopping, and media services. The phone featured unique elements
                        such as Dynamic Perspective 3D visuals and Firefly technology, which could recognize products,
                        songs, and TV shows for instant purchasing through Amazon.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>The Fire Phone was discontinued in August 2015, just over a year after its launch. Poor sales
                        stemmed from its high price, lack of standout features compared to Apple and Samsung devices,
                        and a weak app ecosystem. Amazon wrote down $170 million in unsold inventory. The device quickly
                        became one of Amazon’s most notable hardware missteps, standing out in contrast to the success
                        of its Kindle and Echo product lines. Its short lifespan made it a case study in how even major
                        tech companies can struggle in competitive markets.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                     <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>High price with limited value:</strong> The Fire Phone launched at a premium price
                            point but did not offer enough differentiation to compete with established players like
                            Apple and Samsung.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of compelling features:</strong> The phone’s unique functions, such as Dynamic
                            Perspective and Firefly, failed to provide a strong or lasting reason for customers to
                            switch devices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak app ecosystem:</strong> With limited developer support and fewer apps available
                            compared to Android and iOS, the device lacked the ecosystem strength customers expected
                            from a modern smartphone.</li>
                        <li><strong>Narrow value proposition:</strong> The product was heavily centered on driving users
                            deeper into Amazon’s services, but this focus limited its appeal for consumers seeking a
                            broadly useful and versatile smartphone.</li>

                        <li>Pricing strategies must carefully align with consumer expectations and the perceived value
                            of the product, especially when entering a market already dominated by trusted competitors.
                        </li>
                        <li>Relying solely on ecosystem lock-in is not enough to attract new customers; products must
                            provide independent value that convinces users to switch from alternatives.</li>
