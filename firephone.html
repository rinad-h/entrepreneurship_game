            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>The Amazon Fire Phone was launched in July 2014 as Amazon’s first smartphone, developed under Jeff Bezos and the Amazon Devices team. It was designed to tie users deeper into Amazon’s ecosystem, including Prime, shopping, and media services. However, the phone struggled to compete in a saturated smartphone market.</p>

            <h3>Cause of Death</h3>
            <p>The Fire Phone was discontinued in August 2015, just over a year after its launch. Poor sales stemmed from its high price, lack of standout features compared to Apple and Samsung devices, and a weak app ecosystem. Amazon wrote down $170 million in unsold inventory.</p>
