                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Google Glass was launched in 2012 by Google X (founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page) as a
                        wearable smart
                        glasses device. It promised hands-free access to information, navigation, and augmented reality.
                        The device
                        featured a lightweight frame with a small display prism above the right eye, a built-in camera,
                        voice
                        control, and touch-sensitive controls along the side arm.</p>

                    <h3>What Happened</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>After an initial wave of hype, Glass quickly lost momentum in the consumer market. Early adopters
                        faced
                        criticism when wearing the device in public, media outlets mocked its awkward appearance, and
                        developers
                        abandoned the platform as user interest waned. By 2015, Google halted sales of the consumer
                        version and
                        repositioned Glass toward specialized business and industrial use cases. The enterprise version
                        was later
                        discontinued in March 2023.</p>

                    <h3>Root Causes</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-back">
                    <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>High cost:</strong> At $1,500, Glass was positioned as a luxury gadget rather than a
                            mass-market product. This limited adoption and made it difficult to build a wide user base.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Privacy concerns:</strong> The always-available camera raised fears of being
                            recorded without consent. This not only created public backlash but also damaged trust in
                            the brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unclear value proposition:</strong> While marketed as futuristic, Glass never
                            offered a clear everyday benefit to consumers. Without a practical reason to use it, many
                            saw it as more of a novelty than a necessity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Design challenges:</strong> The bulky, noticeable frame made wearers feel
                            self-conscious. Instead of being stylish or discreet, it became a symbol of awkwardness,
                            which further discouraged mainstream use.</li>

                        <li><strong>Public perception and trust</strong> are part of the value propositionâ€”entrepreneurs
