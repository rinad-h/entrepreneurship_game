            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>Google Glass was launched in 2012 by Google X (founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page) as a wearable smart glasses device. It promised hands-free access to information, navigation, and augmented reality. The product generated huge hype but faced public pushback and limited adoption before being discontinued for consumers in 2015, later pivoting to enterprise use.</p>

        <section class="what-happened">
            <h3>What Happened</h3>
            <p>Despite early buzz, Glass failed in the consumer market. High pricing ($1,500), privacy concerns about the built-in camera, and limited real-world usefulness led to negative media coverage. Sales stagnated, developers lost interest, and Google officially ended the consumer edition in 2015, shifting the product to niche business applications.</p>
