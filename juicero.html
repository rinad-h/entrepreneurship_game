                    <p>Juicero was founded in 2013 and launched its high-tech juicer in 2016. The sleek countertop
                        appliance was Wi-Fi connected and designed to work exclusively with Juicero’s proprietary,
                        pre-packaged produce packs. With the press of a button, the machine would apply thousands of
                        pounds of pressure to squeeze fresh juice directly into the glass, eliminating the need for
                        cleanup or manual preparation. The company positioned this as a premium, modern solution for
                        health-conscious consumers, marketing it around convenience, cleanliness, and superior juice
                        quality.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Juicero faced backlash for its high price and the revelation that the juice packs could be
                        squeezed by hand, making the expensive machine largely unnecessary. Despite raising over $100
                        million in venture capital and receiving significant media attention, consumer adoption remained
                        low and enthusiasm quickly faded. The company struggled to gain traction in the broader market,
                        and by September 2017, Juicero shut down operations entirely.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                     <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>Excessive price point:</strong> The Juicero machine sold for $699 (later lowered to
                            $499), while individual juice packs cost around $5 each — far higher than what most
                            consumers were willing to pay for at-home juice.</li>
                        <li><strong>Over-engineered technology:</strong> Despite its sophistication, the machine’s main
                            function was simply to squeeze pre-packaged juice bags, something consumers quickly
                            discovered could be done by hand without the $699 device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Restricted usability:</strong> Each pack contained a QR code that required the
                            machine to connect to the internet for validation, and the device couldn’t be used with
                            fresh fruits or vegetables, limiting flexibility and perceived value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Niche target market:</strong> Juicero catered mainly to affluent, health-conscious
                            consumers, a segment too narrow to sustain long-term growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliance on hype:</strong> Marketing emphasized high-tech design and Silicon Valley
                            buzz rather than delivering clear consumer benefits tied to real pains, gains, or jobs to be
                            done.</li>
                    </ul>
