            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>Juicero was founded in 2013 and launched its high-tech juicer in 2016. The company aimed to revolutionize the juice industry with a premium, connected appliance that used proprietary juice packs. Marketing focused on convenience and quality, targeting health-conscious consumers willing to pay for fresh, made-to-order juice.</p>

        <section class="what-happened">
            <h3>Cause of Death</h3>
            <p>Juicero faced backlash for its high price and the revelation that the juice packs could be squeezed by hand, making the expensive machine largely unnecessary. Consumer interest never met expectations, and the company shut down in September 2017.</p>
