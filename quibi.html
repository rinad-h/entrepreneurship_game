                    <p>Quibi was founded in 2018 by Jeffrey Katzenberg and led by CEO Meg Whitman. It launched in April
                        2020 as a short-form streaming platform designed specifically for mobile devices, offering
                        episodes that were generally under 10 minutes, branded as “quick bites” creating a new way to
                        tell stories for people on the go. The platform aimed to
                        capture viewers on-the-go by delivering content in brief, easily consumable segments,
                        positioning itself as an alternative to traditional streaming services.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Quibi struggled to attract subscribers, reaching only a fraction of projected users. Launching
                        during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for mobile-only content, and a lack of compelling
                        exclusive shows and inability to watch on TVs contributed to its failure. The platform shut down
                        in October 2020, just six months after launch.</p>

                    <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>Mobile-only viewing:</strong> Restricting content to smartphones limited audience
                            reach and prevented adoption among users who preferred TVs or tablets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weak content library:</strong> The platform lacked strong, exclusive shows that
                            could attract and retain subscribers in a competitive streaming market.</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor timing:</strong> Launching during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for
                            mobile-focused, on-the-go entertainment, as most potential users were staying at home.</li>
                        <li><strong>Late market entry:</strong> Quibi entered an already saturated streaming market
                            dominated by established players, making it difficult to differentiate and capture
                            attention.</li>
