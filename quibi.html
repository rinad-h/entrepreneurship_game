            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>Quibi was founded in 2018 by Jeffrey Katzenberg and led by CEO Meg Whitman. It launched in April 2020 as a short-form streaming platform designed for mobile devices, offering episodes under 10 minutes called "quick bites." Quibi aimed to compete with established streaming services by targeting users on-the-go.</p>

            <h3>Cause of Death</h3>
            <p>Quibi struggled to attract subscribers, reaching only a fraction of projected users. Launching during the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for mobile-only content, and a lack of compelling exclusive shows and inability to watch on TVs contributed to its failure. The platform shut down in October 2020, just six months after launch.</p>
