                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Founded in 1996, Webvan was an ambitious online grocery delivery startup based in Foster City,
                        California. Backed by nearly $800 million in funding, it promised to revolutionize food shopping
                        by delivering groceries directly to consumers' doors within a 30-minute window. The company
                        expanded rapidly to multiple U.S. cities and went public in 1999 during the height of the
                        dot-com boom.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Webvan collapsed in July 2001 after burning through hundreds of millions of dollars. Its
                        aggressive expansion, high infrastructure costs, and lack of sustainable demand led to
                        bankruptcy. Warehouses, fleets of delivery trucks, and a complex logistics system were built
                        before the company proved that enough consumers wanted online groceries. When the dot-com bubble
                        burst, investor confidence vanished and the business folded.</p>

                    <h3>Root Causes</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-back">
                     <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>Overexpansion:</strong> The company rolled out rapidly to multiple cities without
                            first proving that its model was viable and scalable in a single market, stretching
                            resources too thin.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unsustainable costs:</strong> Massive investments in warehouses, delivery trucks,
                            and proprietary technology created high fixed costs that the revenue could not support in
                            the early stages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of consumer demand:</strong> At the time, many customers were not ready to
                            adopt online grocery shopping at scale, meaning sales did not meet expectations despite
                            heavy investment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dot-com bubble burst:</strong> The dot-com bubble was a period in the late 1990s and
                            early 2000s when a lot of internet-based companies were launched very quickly. Investors
                            were excited about the potential of the internet and poured huge amounts of money into these
                            startups, often without checking if the business made sense or could make money.When
                            investor funding dried up, Webvan lacked the
                            financial runway to continue operations or adjust its strategy, leading to rapid collapse.

                            demand and test customer adoption in one or a few key markets before committing to
                            large-scale infrastructure investments.</li>
                        <li>Focus on <strong>financial sustainability</strong> and capital efficiency during early
                            growth rather than pursuing rapid market dominance, ensuring the business can survive
                            fluctuations in funding or demand.</li>
                        <li>Form <strong>strategic partnerships</strong> with existing retailers or delivery networks to
                            leverage existing infrastructure, reduce upfront costs, and accelerate learning about
                            customer behavior without overextending resources.</li>

                            ensuring that demand, operations, and customer adoption are proven on a smaller scale first.
                        </li>
                        <li>Technology-driven convenience only succeeds when it aligns with actual consumer readiness
                            and behavior, meaning timing is as critical as the innovation itself.</li>
                        <li>Rapid growth without a clear path to profitability creates extreme vulnerability, as the
                            business becomes dependent on investor support that can disappear when market conditions
                            shift.</li>
