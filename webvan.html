            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>Founded in 1996, Webvan was an ambitious online grocery delivery startup based in Foster City, California. Backed by nearly $800 million in funding, it promised to revolutionize food shopping by delivering groceries directly to consumers’ doors within a 30-minute window. The company expanded rapidly to multiple U.S. cities and went public in 1999 during the height of the dot-com boom.</p>

            <h3>Cause of Death</h3>
            <p>Webvan collapsed in July 2001 after burning through hundreds of millions of dollars. Its aggressive expansion, high infrastructure costs, and lack of sustainable demand led to bankruptcy. Warehouses, fleets of delivery trucks, and a complex logistics system were built before the company proved that enough consumers wanted online groceries. When the dot-com bubble burst, investor confidence vanished and the business folded.</p>

        <section class="root-causes">
            <h3>Underlying Conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Overexpansion — rapid rollout to multiple cities without proving viability in one market.</li>
                <li>Unsustainable costs — massive spending on warehouses, trucks, and technology infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Lack of demand — consumers were not yet ready to adopt online grocery shopping at scale.</li>
                <li>Dot-com bubble burst — investor funding dried up, leaving the company unable to recover.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Technology-driven convenience must align with actual consumer readiness.</li>
                <li>Rapid growth without profitability leads to collapse when investor support disappears.</li>
