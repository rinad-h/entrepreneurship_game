            <h3>Background Check</h3>
            <p>Keurig launched the Kold machine in 2015 as its ambitious entry into the cold beverage market. The countertop system promised to dispense Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, and other chilled drinks at the push of a button, much like its hot coffee brewers. Backed by a partnership with Coca-Cola and significant marketing investment, Keurig Kold aimed to disrupt the soda industry by bringing it into people’s homes.</p>

            <h3>Cause of Death</h3>
            <p>Despite a high-profile launch, Keurig Kold flopped within a year. Consumers were put off by the $369 price tag and the bulky, 23-pound design. Each drink pod cost significantly more than a canned soda, and the machine took minutes to chill a beverage, undermining its convenience. Poor sales led Keurig to discontinue the product in June 2016 and issue full refunds to customers.</p>

            <h3>Underlying Conditions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive price — the machine retailed at $369, far more than consumers were willing to pay.</li>
                <li>Inefficient performance — drinks took minutes to chill, slower than simply using a fridge.</li>
                <li>Poor value — pods were more expensive than buying soda cans or bottles at the store.</li>
                <li>Bulky design — heavy, noisy, and impractical for most kitchen counters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Autopsy Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Even strong brand partnerships cannot overcome weak product-market fit.</li>
                <li>Consumers will not adopt new appliances unless they provide clear convenience or savings.</li>
                <li>Pricing must align with perceived value, especially against easy alternatives.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Preventative Measures</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Conduct deeper consumer testing before large-scale rollout to validate demand.</li>
                <li>Balance innovation with practicality — ensure new tech improves daily life in a meaningful way.</li>
                <li>Adopt phased launches with prototypes to avoid over-investment in unproven concepts.</li>
            </ul>
