                    <p>Keurig introduced the Kold machine in 2015 to enter the cold beverage market. The system was
                        designed to dispense chilled drinks like Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper at the push of a button,
                        similar to Keurig’s popular coffee brewers. With a partnership from Coca-Cola and substantial
                        marketing support, Keurig Kold aimed to revolutionize home soda consumption.</p>

                <div class="card-back">
                    <p>Despite a high-profile launch, Keurig Kold flopped within a year. Keurig had high expectations
                        for Kold, positioning it as a major new product that could rival the success of its coffee
                        brewers. The machine launched with significant attention, but it was expensive and struggled to
                        attract strong consumer demand. Sales remained low, and the product was ultimately discontinued
                        in June 2016.</p>

                <div class="card-front">
                    <h3>Root Causes</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-back">
                     <ul class="root-causes">
                        <li><strong>High price:</strong> The Keurig Kold retailed for $369, and the single-use soda pods
                            added significant ongoing cost, making it far more expensive than buying ready-made
                            beverages, and out of reach for most average consumers.</li>

                        <li><strong>Limited consumer demand:</strong> The product targeted a very narrow audience
                            interested in chilled soda at home, but the majority of consumers did not feel the need for
                            such a machine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inefficient performance:</strong> Each drink took several minutes to chill and
                            carbonate, providing little time-saving advantage compared to simply using a refrigerator or
                            buying ready-made beverages.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bulky and inconvenient design:</strong> The machine was heavy, noisy, and occupied a
                            large amount of counter space, making it impractical for typical kitchen setups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unappealing taste:</strong> Many users reported that the soda produced by the pods
                            had an artificial or weak flavor, failing to meet expectations for taste and quality.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Engage in thorough <strong>customer discovery</strong> and <strong>validation</strong> to
                            ensure there is real demand for a niche product like home soda machines before committing to
                            large-scale production.</li>
                        <li>Balance <strong>innovation</strong> with practicality by confirming that new technology
                            provides meaningful <strong>gains</strong> or solves real <strong>pains</strong> in
                            consumers’ daily lives.</li>
                        <li>Use <strong>phased launches</strong> and <strong>MVP prototypes</strong> to test
                            performance, usability, and taste with early adopters, reducing risk and avoiding
                            over-investment in unproven concepts.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Even strong brand partnerships and marketing support cannot compensate for a product that
                            lacks a clear <strong>product-market fit</strong>, as consumers will quickly lose interest
                            in solutions that do not meet their real needs.</li>
                        <li>Consumers are unlikely to adopt new appliances unless they provide obvious
                            <strong>convenience</strong> or tangible <strong>cost or time savings</strong>, meaning the
                            product must clearly improve everyday routines to gain traction.</li>
                        <li>Pricing must reflect the product’s perceived value relative to easy and familiar
                            alternatives, since even minor discrepancies between cost and benefit can prevent widespread
                            adoption.</li>
